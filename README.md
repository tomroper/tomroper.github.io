# New York Times
## Top Stories Web App

![NY Times Stories Screen](http://i.imgur.com/HSIE9Gj.png "NY Times Story Screen")

In this project I used an API call to the New York Times to fetch their Top Stories feed to populate the app.

This project uses;

1. HTML5 / CSS3,
2. SASS / SCSS,
3. Javascript / jQuery,
4. AJAX / JSON,
5. Gulp to process JS and SCSS
